# BB_Bio

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide an interactive dashboard to allow research study participants to view their data based on their participant ID. The data presented in a bar graph, a bubble chart and a gauge show details about the bacteria found in their tests and the washing frequency they shared.

### Summary
The dropdown on the left of the dashboard allows the user to select a participant ID. Once a selection is made all the data displayed on the dashboard is refreshed with details of that participant. The bar graph on the dashboard shows the top ten bacteria found for the selected participant. The gauge shows the participant's washing frequency. The bubble chart shows the bacteria present with the size of the bubbles representing the amount of bacteria found.
